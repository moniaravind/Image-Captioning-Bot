This project focuses on creating a multi-modal image captioning system that generates descriptive captions for a given image. Key steps and components of the project include:

Feature Extraction: Utilizing transfer learning techniques, specifically the RESNET50 model, for feature extraction from images.

Data Cleaning: Preprocessing textual data by converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation, and filtering out short words.

Vocabulary Building: Building a vocabulary of frequent words and mapping words to indices for model compatibility.

Caption Prediction: Developing a caption prediction model using a combination of image features and partial captions. 

Embedding: Using pre-trained GloVe embeddings to convert words into numerical vectors for model input.

Model Architecture: Employing a two-part model with one part for image features and another for partial caption sequences. Training involves freezing pre-trained embedding layers and using categorical cross-entropy loss.

Evaluation: Assessing model performance with BLEU scores, comparing predicted captions against reference sentences.

This project represents a comprehensive approach to combining computer vision and natural language processing techniques to automatically generate descriptive captions for images.
